template driven

angular infers the from object from the DOM 



reactive 

From is created programmatically & synchronized with the DOM




Only adding ngModel to form element shows that this is the control

name of control is given by name property in element


local reference of form is given by #f="ngForm" (something exposed by the form)
it gives access of form by the angular

type elementRef won't work 
instead ngForm would work
